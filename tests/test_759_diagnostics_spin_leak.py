"""Per-VIN S-PIN + ABRP credentials must never reach a diagnostics download.

The per-VIN S-PIN map (#759, shipped 2.17.5) is a `{VIN: S-PIN}` dict. It was
not in `_REDACT_KEYS`, so it fell through to the generic dict branch and got
walked: the diagnostics export carried a real VIN as the key and the S-PIN as
a plaintext value. The shared `spin` was redacted the whole time, which is what
made this easy to miss. The two ABRP credentials leaked the same way, despite
the options help text promising "Never logged".

Diagnostics downloads get attached to public issues, so these assertions guard
a live disclosure path, not a cosmetic one.

Everything here is synthetic — never put a real VIN or S-PIN in a test.
