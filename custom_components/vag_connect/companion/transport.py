"""Network-ADB transport for the companion channel — v3.0.0-alpha.

Pure-python ``adb-shell`` over TCP, so no ``adb`` binary is needed inside the
Home Assistant container. This is the only module that talks to the device, and
it is deliberately thin: everything that can be reasoned about without hardware
lives in ``screen.py`` and ``channel.py`` instead.

``adb-shell`` is imported lazily inside the methods, so importing this module
(and running the test suite) never requires the dependency to be present. The
requirement is declared in the manifest for real installs.
