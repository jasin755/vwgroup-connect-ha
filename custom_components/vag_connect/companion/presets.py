"""Per-brand screen presets for the companion (ADB) channel — v3.0.0-alpha.

A preset says how to find a value or a button in one brand's app: which node in
the accessibility tree, and how to turn its text into a number or a bool. The
selector is deliberately layered so it survives small app changes:

1. ``resource_id`` — the most stable handle when the app assigns one.
2. ``content_desc_re`` — the accessibility description, next most stable.
3. ``label_re`` + ``value_from`` — find a known localized label node, then read
   the value from that node's text or a sibling. This is the fallback the
   prior-art projects rely on, and it is why the app language must be German or
   English for now.

HONESTY: only ``volkswagen`` is verified against a real device (a Golf GTE).
The other four are ``verified=False``. Their selectors are seeded from what the
decoded apps and the VW shape suggest, but they are NOT confirmed. An unverified
preset is allowed to read (a wrong read is a wrong number, recoverable) but must
never write (a wrong tap is a physical action on the car). ``CompanionChannel``
enforces that; see ``BrandPreset.writable``.
