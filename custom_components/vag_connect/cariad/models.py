# v2.2.0 Phase 4 PR #17/20 — CUPRA-standalone brand-adapter scaffold.
#
# **BETA — TESTER VALIDATION PENDING.** Pattern matches BRAND_LAMBO
# (#15) + BRAND_BENTLEY (#16): scaffolding-only, NOT wired into the
# ``BRANDS`` registry / config-flow / factory yet.
#
# **What's distinct from existing BRAND_CUPRA**: the current CUPRA
# integration goes through the shared SEAT/CUPRA OLA backend
# (``ola.prod.code.seat.cloud.vwgroup.com``). Per pycupra commit
# 0f3b1c7 + multiple 2026-Q1/Q2 community reports, SEAT and CUPRA
# Connect are progressively migrating to brand-isolated backends —
# pycupra tracks a ``cupra-api.vwgroup.io`` host for the CUPRA-only
# rollout that's expected to fully cut over by 2026-H2.
#
# This scaffold reserves the brand-id ``"cupra_standalone"`` and the
# placeholder host so tester can:
#   1. confirm the actual host once their account flips
#   2. exercise the parser against the cut-over response shapes
#   3. report back which endpoints stayed identical vs. drifted
#
# Once tester confirms host + any endpoint shape deltas, activation
# is a 1-line factory PR PLUS any necessary parser-divergence
# fixes (most fields expected to be identical — OLA-flavoured JSON
# rather than CARIAD-BFF-flavoured).
#
# Until then: factory rejects "cupra_standalone", UI hides it,
# existing "cupra" users see zero behaviour change.
