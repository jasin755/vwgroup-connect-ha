        VW EU users on the `hybrid_full` strategy have no real
        refresh_token (Play Integrity walls the BFF token endpoint).
        The access_token expires after ~2 hours and the integration
        starts returning failed polls. Before this watchdog, the
        symptom was a silently dead integration that users had to
        reload by hand (a common pattern in the upstream VW HA
        community ran on template-trigger automations).

        Gating logic:
          - Active strategy must be `hybrid_full`. Other strategies
            (`device_grant`, `classic`, `data_act_portal`) handle
            their own refresh paths via refresh_token / re-fetch.
          - All VINs must have failure_count >= 2 (single transient
            hiccups do not trigger).
          - All VINs must have last_good_at older than
            2x scan_interval (ensures we are not racing a temporary
            network blip).

        using the same Brand-ID credentials stored in entry.data. On
        success, the access_token is refreshed in place and the next
        poll cycle succeeds without user interaction. On failure,
        we fall through to standard behaviour, the existing outer
        exception handler then triggers the HA reauth dialog.
