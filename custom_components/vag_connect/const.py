# v2.8.0 quick-win B — native-app deeplink schemes per brand. Used by
# the vag_connect.open_app service to emit an event that dashboards can
# subscribe to in order to open the brand's mobile app on iOS/Android.
# Values sourced from each brand's published intent-filter scheme
# (Android AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist CFBundleURLSchemes).
# Map of brand -> base URL; the action is appended as a path segment
# if the app supports it (the dashboard card decides whether to keep
# or strip the action based on platform behaviour).
#
# v2.10.0 — verification status: the smali extractions in _private/ carry
# qmauth + x_headers + oauth client_ids + token URLs but not the URI scheme
# strings (those live in AndroidManifest.xml + iOS Info.plist, not in the
# decompiled bytecode). Until a fresh manifest sweep is added the schemes
# stay as published in each brand's launcher metadata + community deeplink
# reports. The schemes open the apps reliably; the action path appended
# after ``://`` may not always land on the expected screen — the dashboard
# card falls back to opening the app's home screen on path-mismatch.
